# weather_app

In this project, I've built a weather app.
So it will essentially get some data from an API and display it to the user in the
console.
So if we run this program, we can choose a city.
And for this example, I'll type in Tokyo and it's going to give us data for the next five days, every
three hours.

Purpose:
To provide users with weather data for a specific city.

Functionality:
Fetches weather information from an API and displays it in the console.

User Interaction: 
Allows users to input a city name and retrieves weather forecasts.
